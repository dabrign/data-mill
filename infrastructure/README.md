# Data-Mill: Setup & Development

## 1. Infrastructure setup
* LOCATION: local (-l) to the node by installing minikube, remote (-r) to a VM or a Cluster
* ACTION: install (-i) the components or delete them (-d) using Helm
* CONFIG: the default config file for each component is config.yaml, -f [filename] defines a different project config file
* COMPONENT: runs the ACTION only for the specific component, regardless of the project flavour

```
Usage: ./run.sh [debug-mode] [params] [options]
  debug mode:
    DEBUG: -d
  params:
    LOCATION: -l (local cluster), -r (remote cluster)
    ACTION: -s (start only), -i (install), -u (uninstall)
  options:
    CONFIG_FILE: -f filename.yaml
      -> overwrites the default component configuration filename
    TARGET_FILE: -t filename.yaml
      -> overwrites the default k8s configuration filename
    COMPONENT: -c component_name
```

Components are stored at in the *components* subfolder. Each component consists of a setup.sh and a bunch of config_*.yaml files, possibly reflecting different environments or cluster setups.
The actual configuration file for the specific component is then referenced from therein, e.g.:

```
kafka:
  release: kafka
  config_file: kafka_config.yaml
```

The project-wide configuration is stored in the infrastructure flavours folder as `default.yaml`:
```
project:
  # namespace
  k8s_namespace: data-mill
  # the port on which the K8s UI is exposed
  proxy_port: 8088
  # the flavour is used to list all the components to be used in the project
  flavour: all
  # k8s default config, can be overwritten with -t filename
  k8s_default_config: default_uc.yaml
  # component default config, can be overwritten with -f filename
  component_default_config: config.yaml
  # set the data folder
  data_folder: data
```

The flavour attribute indicates which components are to be included in the project the default is related to.
You can use `flavour: all` or list the component names e.g. `flavour: spark, jupyterhub`.
When using `flavour: all` the components are taken in alphabetical order, so it is necessary to list them if you have dependencies across them.
The `k8s_default_config` is used to specify the default filename for cluster configuration, this can be overwritten with `-t filename`.
For instance, `default_uc.yaml` in `k8s/configs` specifies a microk8s cluster. This target can be overwritten with `-t` or directly in the flavour file, for instance using `default_mc.yaml` to target a minikube cluster.
The `component_default_config` is used to specify the default configuration filename for each component, and can be overwritten with `-f filename`.
With `-f filename` we can specify a different flavour than the default one, and overwrite the config of each file (if `filename` exists, or fallback to `component_default_config` where it 
doesn't). The data folder is where the code examples are stored, along with the bucket structure that we want replicated to the local datalake.

The projects is structured over the following folders:
* components - containing the installable components
* data - is mounted as PV and PVC and eventually available in the Minio S3 data lake, it can be used to provide example code
* flavours - where configurations are stored. A file define the project details, and a flavour, i.e. a group of components to be used in the project
* helm-charts - contains the code used to develop helm charts that were not available to us at time of development
* k8s - contains the cluster setup and configuration data
* registry - contains the details to manage a local docker registry
* utils - contains bash utility functions (e.g. arg parsing)

## 2. Common functions

### 2.1 Start existing cluster
An existing cluster can be started as follows:
```
./run.sh -i -l -s
```
This will use the default flavour and k8s config. 
To overwrite this behavior a different flavour can be passed with `-f flavour_config.yaml` or a different target file `-t target_config.yaml` can be set.

### 2.2 Debugging environment
A debugging environment (i.e., a pod within the namespace providing an interactive session) can be spawned using `run.sh -d`.

### 2.3 Installing local helm charts
We provide a subfolder to collect a few helm-chart that were not yet offered at the time of development.   
To install a helm chart from the infrastructure folder you would normally run something like:
```
helm install --dry-run --debug --name mlflow-test --namespace data-mill helm-charts/mlflow/
helm install --name mlflow-test --namespace data-mill helm-charts/mlflow/
```
with the first command testing the chart and the second actually deploying it on the default data-mill namespace.

Alternatively, just add our Git Repo as Helm repo too:
```
helm repo add data-mill https://data-mill-cloud.github.io/data-mill/helm-charts/
```

## 3. Developing applications
Please check the `data` folder for examples on how to connect to services, such as S3, Spark, Dask, Keras/Tensorflow.

## 4. Accessing the Data Lake and Data versioning
We use minio as local S3 datalake service. Code examples are directly copied to the minio pod and exposed as a bucket.
Within the cluster, Minio can be accessed at <minio-release>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local on port 9000 (or http://<minio-release>:9000).
Minio can also be managed from it minio/mc client, using port forwarding to the pod:
```
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace <namespace> -l "release=<minio-release>" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 9000 --namespace <namespace>
```
You can follow [this guide](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide) to install the mc client. For instance:
```
mc config host add <ALIAS> <YOUR-S3-ENDPOINT> <YOUR-ACCESS-KEY> <YOUR-SECRET-KEY> <API-SIGNATURE>
```
Now we can manage the objects on the datalake, for instance create (`mc mb minio/mybucket`), list (`mc ls minio/mybucket`), delete (`mc rm minio/mybucket/myfile`).

Pachyderm is provided for code versioning purposes. This component is using the default minio datalake, where it creates a specific bucket.
The utility pachctl can be installed to interact with Pachyderm, see the guide [here](http://docs.pachyderm.io/en/latest/getting_started/local_installation.html).
Once pachctl is available, we can point it to the cluster's master node, or in case of a single node setup like minikube or mikrok8s to the sole node available:
```
export ADDRESS=$(minikube ip)":30650"
```
We can test the correct connection to the cluster by querying the version, for instance:
```
$ pachctl version
COMPONENT           VERSION
pachctl             1.8.2
pachd               1.7.3
```
This shows that both the client and server were correctly setup. You can now go on with the official tutorial, [here](https://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/beginner_tutorial.html).
The example below creates a new repo called images and lists its content, both before and after uploading an image from the web.
```
pachctl create-repo images
pachctl list-repo
pachctl put-file images master liberty.png -f http://imgur.com/46Q8nDz.png
pachctl list-repo
```

## 5. Debugging utils

List containers running in each pod:
```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' | sort
```

Retrieve the secrets used for the datalake:
```
$(kubectl -n <namespace> get secrets <minio-deployment> -o jsonpath="{.data.accesskey}" | base64 -d)
$(kubectl -n <namespace> get secrets <minio-deployment> -o jsonpath="{.data.secretkey}" | base64 -d)
```
